Description: Provides data science tools for conservation science, including
    methods for environmental data analysis, humidity calculations,
    sustainability metrics, engineering calculations, and data
    visualisation. Supports conservators, scientists, and engineers
    working with cultural heritage preventive conservation data.
    The package is motivated by the framework outlined 
    in Cosaert and Beltran et al. (2022)
