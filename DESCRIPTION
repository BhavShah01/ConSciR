Description: Provides data science tools for conservation science, including
    methods for environmental analysis applications, humidity calculations,
    sustainability metrics, engineering calculations, and data
    visualisation. Supports conservators, scientists, and engineers
    working with cultural heritage data.
    The package was motivated by the developing tools and frameworks outlined 
    in Cosaert and Beltran et al. (2022) 
    "Tools for the Analysis of Collection Environments"
