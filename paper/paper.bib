Historical and cultural contexts are as significant as the methods and material properties, which is something the scientific templates for research data management rarely take into account. While the {FAIR} data principles are a good foundation, they do not offer enough practical help to researchers facing increasing demands from funders and collaborators. In order to identify the issues and needs that arise \textquotedbllefton the ground floor\textquotedblright, the staff at the Heritage Laboratory at the Swedish National Heritage Board took part in a series of workshops with case studies. The results were used to develop guides for good data practices and a list of recommended online vocabularies for standardised descriptions, necessary for findable and interoperable data. However, the project also identified areas where there is a lack of useful vocabularies and the consequences this could have for discoverability of heritage studies on materials from areas of the world that have historically been marginalised by Western culture. If Heritage Science as a global field of study is to reach its full potential this must be addressed.}

The Toolbox is a Microsoft\textregistered Excel\textregistered workbook with complex {VBA} codes optimised to process large datasets efficiently and quickly. The Toolbox takes user-provided climate data (up to 8000 sets of temperature, T, and relative humidity, rh, data) and characterises the climates in terms of critical parameters for stresses and mechanical damage, risk and magnitude of mould, relative permanence compared to (selectable) reference specifications, the proportion of data lying within and without selectable specification ranges, and the proportion of rh data swings exceeding a given magnitude. The interface is easily customisable, allowing users to input desired specification ranges, insert opening and closing times (to allow for different temperature specifications for periods when a space is open and occupied to when it is closed and empty), selectively change material critical strain parameters, and adjust the cycle periods for stress analysis. Results are summarised in a range of different graphical and tabular outputs and can be processed further to compare and rank spaces for their suitability to house different collections.}

abstract = {The collection of temperature (T) and relative humidity ({RH}) data is a ubiquitous component of collection management, and plays a central role in understanding the preservation state of the collection, building envelope performance, climate control system operation, and loan policies. Such insights require that the data be analyzed and interpreted, with the results effectively communicated to stakeholders with varying levels of expertise. Analysis of T and {RH} data often relies on the native software from sensor/data logger producers. However, there exist several conservation-focused analysis tools that examine this data from complementary perspectives; their collective presentation as a \textquotelefttoolkit\textquoteright allows users to draw upon the individual strengths of each, but is hampered by limited awareness of the available tools and a lack of didactic support to foster their effective use. The Managing Collection Environments Initiative at the Getty Conservation Institute has developed a workshop curriculum that begins to address this gap by (a) establishing a baseline of knowledge on the fundamentals of data analysis and visualization, (b) presenting a survey of existing online T and {RH} analysis tools, and (c) demonstrating their application and interpretation for various case studies. To date, the authors have organized two virtual synchronous workshops, and plan to development a free asynchronous course.}

abstract = {Abstract Although the energy codes or construction standards were considerably improved in the last decades, there are continuous reports on mold growth problems in buildings. Numerical prediction can be useful in assessing the risk of mold growth in new constructions and retrofit applications. Two well-known models exist and are widely used: the {VTT} model and the biohygrothermal {IBP} model. While the {VTT} model is an experimentally validated empirical model based on visual findings of mold growth, the biohygrothermal method models the growth of a mold hyphen in mm as a function of the transient ambient conditions. Since a hyphen is not visible to the naked eye it is not evident at what length the growth will become a nuisance. The {VTT} model uses a very clear six-step evaluation: the so-called mold index describing the intensity of growth on the surface. By comparing the results of the biohygrothermal and the {VTT} model it is possible to use the clear and acknowledged rating measure of the mold index also for the {IBP} model. For this purpose, a conversion function has been developed allowing the transformation of the calculated hyphen growth, in mm, into the mold index with a high level of correspondence. In collaboration of {VTT} and {IBP} a new postprocessor for the {VTT} model was developed which can be used to assess both: Results from hygrothermal numerical simulations or measured data. A classification employing a traffic light indicator helps to interpret the mold growth risk: green means no risk, red is not acceptable, while the yellow range indicates a possible risk and requires a specific evaluation.}

abstract = {Mould growth is a common problem in building envelopes. This issue is usually caused by poor design and construction of walls and results from the difference between indoor and outdoor climatic conditions. Mould spores produced by mouldy walls may diffuse into the air, thereby affecting indoor air quality and threatening occupant health. Therefore, it is important to predict the risk of mould growth in building envelopes under various conditions. This study selected three buildings from a traditional community in Shanghai, China. First, the mould species in these building envelopes were identified. Based on the identification results, the growth rate of the corresponding genera was extracted from the literature to establish an isoline model that describes mould growth on the agar surface. In addition, the mould growth rate between and outside the isoline areas was predicted by modifying the Sautour model to relevant air temperature and humidity conditions. According to the results of the proposed model, the critical temperature and humidity that allow the growth of representative moulds from the buildings selected for this study can be expressed as φ=0.002633·cosh[0.10083·( θ-30)]+0.7153. The accuracy of the above model was verified experimentally, and the maximum relative error of the growth rate was within 25\%.}
