\title{Calculate Equilibrium Moisture Content for wood (EMC)}
\usage{
calcEMC_wood(Temp, RH)
}
\arguments{
\item{Temp}{Temperature (Â°Celsius)}

\item{RH}{Relative Humidity (0-100\%)}
}
\value{
EMC, Equilibrium Moisture Content (0-100\%)
}
\description{
This function calculates the Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC) of wood
based on relative humidity and temperature.

Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC) is the moisture content at which a material,
such as wood or other hygroscopic substanceshas reached an equilibrium with its
environment and is no longer gaining or losing moisture under specific
temperature and relative humidity.
