\usage{
tidy_TRHdata(
  mydata,
  Site = "Site",
  Sensor = "Sensor",
  Date = "Date",
  Temp = "Temp",
  RH = "RH",
  avg_time = "none",
  avg_statistic = "median",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{A data frame containing TRH data. Ideally, this should have
columns for "Site", "Sensor", "Date", "Temp" (temperature), and "RH" (relative humidity).
The function requires at least the date, temperature, and relative humidity columns to be present.
Site and sensor columns are optional; if missing, the function will add default
columns named "Site" and "Sensor" respectively with values below.}

\item{Site}{A string specifying the name of the column in `mydata` that contains
location information. If missing, defaults to "Site".}

\item{Sensor}{A string specifying the name of the column in `mydata` that contains
sensor information. If missing, defaults to "Sensor".}

\item{Date}{A string specifying the name of the column in `mydata` that contains
date information. Default is "Date". The column should ideally contain ISO 8601
date-time formatted strings (e.g. "2025-01-01 00:00:00"), but the function will try to
parse a variety of common datetime formats.}

\item{Temp}{A string specifying the name of the column in `mydata` that contains
temperature data. Default is "Temp".}

\item{RH}{A string specifying the name of the column in `mydata` that contains
relative humidity data. Default is "RH".}

\item{avg_time}{Character string specifying the averaging interval.
One of "none" (no averaging), "hour", "day", or "month", etc.
See \code{openair::timeAverage()} for more options.}

\item{avg_statistic}{Statistic for averaging; default is "median".
See \code{openair::timeAverage()} for more options.}

\item{avg_groups}{Character vector specifying grouping columns for time-averaging.
These are then returned as factors. Default is c("Site", "Sensor").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to supply to \code{openair::timeAverage()}.}
}
\value{
A tidy data frame with processed TRH data. When averaging,
  date times are floored, Temp and RH are averaged, groups are factored,
  and missing date times are padded with NA rows.
}
\description{
This function tidies and processes temperature, relative humidity, and date data
from a given dataset. Dataset should minimally have "Date", "Temp" and "RH" columns.

It filters out rows with missing dates, attempts to parse dates,
converts temperature and humidity to numeric types, and groups the data by Site,
Sensor, and Date based on the averaging interval.

If the site or sensor columns are not present in the data, the function
defaults to adding columns named "Site" and "Sensor".
This can be changed in the arguments.

When an averaging option of "hour", "day", "month" is selected,
it uses \code{openair::timeAverage()} to floor datetimes and calculate averages,
the default is median average.
See \code{openair::timeAverage()} for more options for averaging windows and statistics.
Missing time points are padded with NA.


\itemize{
  \item Filters out rows with missing dates.
  \item Renames columns for consistency.
  \item Converts temperature and relative humidity to numeric.
  \item Adds default columns "Site" and "Sensor" when missing or not supplied in args.
  \item Rounds dates down to the nearest hour, day, or month as per `avg_time`.
         See \code{openair::timeAverage()} for more options. Default is "none".
  \item Calculates averages for temperature and relative humidity according to `avg_statistic`.
         See \code{openair::timeAverage()} for more options. Default is "median".
  \item Pads data with missing datetime rows having NA values for other columns if `avg_time` is chosen.
  \item Filters out implausible temperature and humidity values (outside -50-80Â°C and 0-100\%RH).
